Difference between 32 and 64 bit JVM
	- if heap size < 3GB
		+ 32 bit size JVM willl be faster, because each pointer in the memory will be smaller
	- for a 32 bit JVM, the total memory required for the application, must not exceed 4GB
	- if application  uses a lot of longs / doubles , 64 bit JVM is faster
	- for small application, 32 bit is better than 64 bit JVM
	- maximum heap size in 64 bit JVM, is determined by OS, on windows is about 1.2GB
	- for 32 bit JVM, only C1 compiler is available
	- for 64 bit JVM, both C1 and C2 compilers are availables
	- C1 compiler is called Client compiler - applications whith short life, run a process and then finishes
		- short lived application start time is important (as quick as possible, because it will not run for very long)
	- C2 compiler is called server compiler - application that runs for a long time, such a web server
		- long lived application start time is less important 
	- so 32 bit JVM may perform better

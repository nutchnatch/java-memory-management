* GralVM
	- alternative for JVM
	- alternative for java compiler
	- native compiler (no JVM required)
		. poentialy quicker than current JVM


* Other JVM Languages
	- kotlin removes the reference to null in java
		. this comes at a performance cust
	- to inspect the generated bytecode, we can use JavaP
		$ javap -v Main.class

		.  it allows to see
			+ constant pool
				- list of all the constants in the class
			+ all the bytecode commands that will be executed by JVM in order to run the program

	- decompilers - translate bytecode into original jvaa code
		+ CFR
			. easy to use
			. include almost all java version
			. it is a simply .jar file (cfr-0.142.jar)
				$ java -jar cfr-0.142.jar JavaMain.class
